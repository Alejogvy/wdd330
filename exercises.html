                    <h3>Essential Protein Tips</h3>
                    <p>If we mention the name George Hackenschmidt, you might not recognize it, but he was once a superstar, on par with today’s Ilia Topuria or Connor McGregor. Considered one of the strongest men of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, George was a weightlifter and wrestler, credited with over 2,000 wrestling victories. He is also known for inventing what we now call the bench press.</p>
                    <p>In 1899, using a barbell with weights, Hackenschmidt lifted 164 kilograms in a strict press exercise. He did this, as was common at the time, lying on the floor. Gradually, he adapted to using boxes or wooden benches, allowing for more precise movements and heavier loads. Although Hackenschmidt wasn’t the first to lie on an object to lift weights, his popularity led to the development of a gym bench industry by the 1920s.</p>
                    <p>Using a bench in training has many benefits. It allows for a wide range of exercises targeting different body parts, such as the chest, triceps, biceps, shoulders, back, and legs. Bench work helps to exercise the body comprehensively, achieving balanced development.</p>

                    <h3>Summer Supplementation</h3>
                    <p>Trying to build large, muscular arms is undoubtedly a goal for many people, especially those who frequent gyms and focus on hypertrophy and achieving a balanced physique. However, strong arms aren’t just for weightlifters. Arm strength is important for many daily tasks and functional activities, such as carrying groceries, lifting children, hanging curtains, or opening doors.</p>
                    <p>Maintaining arm strength requires effort, especially as we age. After about 35 years, arm strength and overall muscle mass begin to decrease by 1% annually. After 60 years, we can lose up to 3% of muscle mass per year. This muscle loss can reduce strength, limit range of motion, and increase injury risk.</p>
                    <p>Incorporating arm-focused exercises into our routines is essential for maintaining strength over the years. It’s also crucial for stronger bones, better balance, and maintaining functional capacity. Exercises like bicep curls and tricep extensions are effective, but they target individual muscles. Including compound movements and functional exercises can provide more comprehensive benefits.</p>

                    <h3>Collagen with Peptides</h3>
                    <p>Some days, the clock seems to run out, and we find ourselves overwhelmed by the demands of work, family responsibilities, and numerous obligations. These factors combine to prevent us from enjoying the peace that many, myself included, find in training.</p>
                    <p>On those overwhelming days or weeks when we can’t stick to our planned routines, having a Plan B is crucial. For me, that alternative is the kettlebell. This equipment is often considered a portable gym or the Swiss army knife of fitness, and I completely agree. Incorporating kettlebells into our routines is an effective way to build strength and muscle, improve cardiovascular fitness, and maintain a healthy weight.</p>
                    <p>In my case, I use kettlebells in nearly all my workouts because they allow for a wide range of movements, providing a complete training session that targets major muscle groups.</p>
